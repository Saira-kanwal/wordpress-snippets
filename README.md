# WordPress Custom Code Library

This repository contains custom code snippets, templates, and Elementor extensions I built for WordPress projects.  
Instead of relying on additional plugins, I created lightweight, reusable solutions to extend functionality and fill in missing features.

## 📂 Folder Structure
- **/snippets/** → Small reusable PHP/JS/CSS snippets  
- **/templates/** → Custom WordPress/Elementor templates  
- **/overrides/** → Theme and plugin overrides  
- **/assets/** → Supporting assets (images, scripts, styles)  

## 🚀 Usage
- Copy the required file/folder into your WordPress project.  
- Adjust paths and selectors if necessary.  
- Use as drop-in replacements or enhancements for missing features.  

## 💡 Why This Repo?
- Avoid installing extra plugins for small tasks  
- Keep track of custom work for future reuse  
- Faster development with a ready-to-use code library  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- WordPress  
- Elementor  
- PHP / JavaScript / CSS  

## 📌 Notes
This repo is a personal library, but can be used by others who want lightweight alternatives to plugins and Elementor limitations.
